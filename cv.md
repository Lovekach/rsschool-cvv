# **About Me:**

My name is Valery, I am 31 years old. I have a higher technical education. For 5 years he worked as an engineer at the enterprise, was engaged in the adjustment and installation of packaging equipment, as well as equipment for the processing of plastic products. After some time, I realized that this job does not bring me pleasure, so I began to study various IT technologies. I settled on learning the Java Script language. While I like it, let's see how far I can go in this area.
