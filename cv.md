## About Me
Hello, my names Valery, I'm 31 years old. I have a higher technical education. For 5 years i'm worked as an engineer at the enterprise, was engaged in the adjustment and installation of packaging equipment, as well as equipment for the processing of plastic products. After some time, I realized that this job does not bring me pleasure, and began to study various IT-technologies. I settled on learning the Java Script. While I like it, let's see how far I can go in this area.

    count: 2,
}, {
    name: 'Мoлоко',
    price: 50,
    count: 1,
